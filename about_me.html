    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>	
        I am a software engineer who is always striving to improve my technical knowledge. Growing up in the 2000s,
         technology has always been a part of my life, from playing Gamecube games with my sister as a child, to learning to write my own code, 
         my understanding of technology has advanced dramatically over the course of my life. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My computer science journey started in high school, where my high school had a program with the local community college to allow students 
        to graduate from high school and the community college with an associates degree in computer science at the same time. Actually, 
        I technically graduated from the community college before high school. During this time, 
        I gained a foundational knowledge of Java and C++, as well as an understanding of basic coding concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
        After graduating from high school, I went to Illinois State University, where my knowledge of computers and coding grew even further.
         Beyond expanding my knowledge of Java and C++, I also learned Python, my favorite programming language.
          Other topics I learned included SQL, networking, Arduino, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, 
          although I personally donâ€™t like using AI in my work. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My education extended beyond just the classroom. I also joined the game development club at ISU,
         where I learned how to use Unity to create video games with a team of fellow students. 
         I also worked as a technical stagehand at ISU, someone who sets up audio and video for events happening throughout campus. 
         I helped set up for everything from concerts to formal dinners and galas. While not directly related to computer science, 
         this did give me experience with a lot of equipment that I previously had not had experience with, 
         as well as experience working with clients setting up events to meet their standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        After graduating, I was unable to get a job. Since then I have been trying to expand my knowledge further.
         I built a computer so that I could have a better understanding of the hardware that makes a computer, 
         and also so that I could have a powerful computer I could use to make future projects. 
         I then became an AWS cloud practitioner so that I would know how to use Amazon Web Services. 
    </p>
    <p>
        That brings me to this point, and this website. I wanted to learn how to make a website using HTML, 
        and I thought the best thing to do was make a personal website to show off the future projects that I work on.
         Right now, this website is very basic, but I hope it will improve as I create new projects, and as I improve my html knowledge.
    </p>
