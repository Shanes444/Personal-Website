        <h2>Personal Website</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of this project was to create a personal website to show off the future projects that I work on
            In order to accomplish this project, I needed to learn HTML, something that I have no prior experience with.
            Beyond HTML, I also had to work with CSS for the styling of the website. This website is still a work in
            progress, but I plan to come back to it from time to time, both to improve the website and to add future projects 
            to it. The website is hosted on Github right now, and at some point in the future I will buy a domain for it. 
            If you want to look at the code for the website, then press ctrl + shift + c on Windows/Linux, or cmd + shift + c
            on mac to use inspect element.

        <h2>Gress Custom Craft Corner Website</h2>
        <p>
            This is a website designed for my mother's craft business. I designed it using Showit, a website building service.
            I started off using a template, and then edited it for the final website. I ended up having to make the shop pages
            essentially from scratch since the template did not provide adequate pages for it. My mother provided most of the text
            and images, while I did all of the web design. For the shop, I encorporated Shopify, a service for online stores.
            I then used the Shopify buy button extension in order to allow people to purchase items through the website. 
            The biggest challenge was allowing people to have custom orders. This is currently the last part of the website that 
            needs to be finished. Neither Shopify or Showit provide adequate options for this. The solution I came up was to have
            a form pop up when a button pressed, and then having the add to cart button appear once the form is submitted. This 
            is not ideal for me, since this means that the form will still be submitted even if the item is ultimately not purchased,
            but it is the best solution I could come up with.
